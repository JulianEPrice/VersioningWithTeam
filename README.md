CS 495 Assignment
Alex Thomas - This summer I did not do much, as many places were closed due to Covid. One of the things I did do, though, was go to Michigan to Harbor Springs and spend about three weeks there. While there we water skiied and hiked, mainly just trying to stay away from crowded places and relaxing. I also worked a little bit in the summer, but much of the summer constituted time where my workplace was closed, so I didn't do much working.
